# Case Scenario

Our client Experimentarium is looking for upgrading Magento 1 theme into Magento 2 theme.

Your tasks:

- New M2 theme should have the same look and feel as the M1 theme. We expect you to finish at least
home page (including a responsive feature).
- Main navigation: try not use the third-party module. If you are having trouble to make this mega menu feature, just try to style existing magento 2 navigation as close as possible to the current magento 1 navigation.
- The banner hero: again, try not to use the third-party module for this block. One of the solution could be to use some existing script (owl, slick...) for a carousel along with Magentoâ€™s Static block (this is just a hint, so, different solution (approach) will also be acceptable).
- List of products on the home page: You can use Widget for this block (show New products or use some other condition in Widget options)

## Nice to have:

If you have time, you can complete and product list, product view, cart and checkout page, however this is not a must-have request.

### Guidelines

- Use a local instance of the latest Magento Open Source with the sample data pack installed.
- There is no time limit but please indicate how much time you did spend on each attempted task.
- Do not hesitate to contact us by email if you have any questions.
- You are free to interpret the solution as you see fit best, but all aspects of the task should be done to Magento best practices and coding standards. We are looking, not just for code quality and best use of Magento standards & methods, but also your approach to the solution.
- Send all completed code, data files and SQL dump of database as a ZIP archive to email address provided.
